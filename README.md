### YAALO: Movie Streaming App

YAALO is a feature-rich movie streaming app designed to offer seamless access to movies and series. It leverages modern technologies to ensure efficient data collection, robust storage, and smooth streaming for users.

### How It Works:

#### 1. **Data Collection and Processing**

- **Web Scraping with Puppeteer**:  
  Utilize Puppeteer, a Node.js library, to scrape movie information (title, description, banners, genres, etc.) and download links from trusted movie download websites.
  - Ensure compliance with website scraping policies to avoid legal issues.
  - Automate the collection process to keep the database updated with the latest releases.
  - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms to manage dynamic website structures.

#### 2. **Database Integration**

- **Storing Movie Information**:  
  Use **Mongoose** with MongoDB to structure and store movie data efficiently. The Movie/Series model can include:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Banner URLs
  - Genre
  - Release Year
  - Download Links (Generated during Puppeteer collection)
  - Metadata such as duration and file size
  - Ratings and user reviews for enhanced user experience

#### 3. **Backend API with Express**

- **RESTful APIs**:  
  Create APIs using **Express.js** to manage movie data and provide endpoints for the frontend app:
  - `GET /movies`: Retrieve a list of all movies.
  - `GET /movies/:id`: Fetch detailed information for a specific movie.
  - `POST /movies`: Add new movies (Admin use only).
  - `PUT /movies/:id`: Update movie details.
  - `DELETE /movies/:id`: Remove movies from the database.

#### 4. **Frontend Integration**

- **Interactive UI**:  
  Build a user-friendly frontend app using modern frameworks like **React.js** or **Next.js**:
  - Display movie information dynamically fetched from the backend.
  - Allow users to search, filter, and select movies.
  - Provide a responsive layout for cross-platform compatibility (desktop, mobile).

#### 5. **On-Demand Movie Streaming**

- **Dynamic Downloading and Streaming**:
  - When a user selects a movie, the backend dynamically downloads the movie from the stored links and saves it in the server's storage.
  - Use **FFmpeg** or similar tools to process and prepare the movie file for streaming.
  - Implement **chunked streaming** using HTTP to send data in manageable segments, reducing latency and improving performance.

#### 6. **Optimized Streaming**

- **Streamable Responses**:  
  Create endpoints for streaming with `Content-Range` headers to support seeking functionality.
  - Utilize **Node.js streams** to handle large movie files efficiently without overloading server memory.
  - Implement **caching** for frequently accessed movies to reduce redundant downloads.
  - Leverage **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** for scalable and faster streaming.

### Key Features and Techniques:

1. **Scalability**:

   - Use **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for containerized deployment, ensuring smooth scaling as user demand grows.

2. **Security**:

   - Implement **JWT-based authentication** for user sessions.
   - Encrypt sensitive data, including download links, to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Use **Redis** for caching movie metadata and reducing database queries.
   - Enable gzip compression for API responses.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:

   - Integrate tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor application performance.
   - Use structured logging tools like **Winston** for tracking application behavior.

5. **User Engagement**:

   - Allow users to create watchlists and rate movies.
   - Notify users about new movie arrivals via email or in-app notifications using tools like **SendGrid** or **Firebase**.

6. **Resilience**:
   - Use a **queue-based system** (e.g., **RabbitMQ** or **Bull.js**) to handle high-volume movie downloads.
   - Implement retry logic for failed downloads or streaming issues.
